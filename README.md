# NYC Taxi Trips Prediction with RNN

## Abstract:
Understanding time-related geospatial data is a very interesting and challenging task, but is necessary to support an efficient and intelligent urban environment. In this paper we model taxi trips in New York City from historical data and by using a recurrent neural network. The goal of the model is to gain a better understanding of the spatial-temporal patterns related to taxi travel in New York City, so that we can better predict demand. This paper uses the taxi domain to explore the usage of different neural network models for this type of prediction task. In particular, three types of recurrent neural network cells are evaluated: vanilla cells, Long Short Term Memory cells, and Neural Turing Machine cells. The internal states of these models are also examined, during the learning process, to b
